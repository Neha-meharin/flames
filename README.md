# 💕 FLAMES Love Calculator 💕  

This is a fun web-based FLAMES (Friendship, Love, Affection, Marriage, Enemy, Sibling) calculator that predicts the relationship between two people based on their names. It follows a playful algorithm to generate a relationship outcome.  

## 🎯 Features  
- Beautiful, romantic-themed UI with a soft pink color scheme  
- Enter two names and find out your relationship result instantly  
- Interactive and engaging design with animations  

## 🚀 How It Works  
1. Enter your name and your partner's name in the input fields.  
2. Click the **"Find Relationship 💖"** button.  
3. The script processes the names, applies a simple FLAMES calculation, and displays the result.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **HTML** for structure  
- **CSS** for styling and animations  
- **JavaScript** for logic and interactivity  

## 💡 How the Calculation Works  
1. The names are converted to lowercase and spaces are removed.  
2. The combined length of both names is taken and used to determine an index.  
3. The index is mapped to the FLAMES categories:  
   - **F** - Friendship  
   - **L** - Love ❤️  
   - **A** - Affection  
   - **M** - Marriage  
   - **E** - Enemy  
   - **S** - Sibling  
4. The result is displayed in the UI.
